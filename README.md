# cdk-nextjs-serverless
An AWS CDK pattern construct for deploying a NextJS application on Lambda, CloudFront, and S3

**NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT BUT IS EXPECTING RELEASE IN COMING WEEKS.**
The current published "stable" version is not fully tested and optimized, but worked for a simple deploy I tried. Feel free to use it if you'd like, but don't expect a fool-proof package as of yet. Code based off of template NextJS CDK proejct https://github.com/simonireilly/nextjs-aws-cdk which uses the Builder package from the Serverless Framework to output handlers and static files.
